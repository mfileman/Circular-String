# Circular-String
This was a project for my bioinformatics class. We studied the circular string problem and its application to bioinformatics and sequence generation / reconstruction. This project solves the circular string problem taking in an integer k, by creating a DeBruijn graph and generating a Euler cycle from it (the edges corresponding to all possible binary k-mers).
